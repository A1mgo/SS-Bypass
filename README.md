Its bassically a .exe that runs in the backround consumming around 5% of cpu its hidden as "Virtual Machine Management Service" in task manager.
U Should  rename the .exe after compiling it to the same name "Virtual Machine Management Service" and put it in system32 or on a usb
Also One of my friends shared with me a .exe that bypasses ocean with error code 15 but this is *USE AT OWN RISK* as i dont have the source code
